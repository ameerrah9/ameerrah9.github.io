Ruby on Rails is a web framework that provides developers the tools they need in order to build applications. Rails is written in the Ruby programming language and it is incredibly smart because it makes assumptions about what every developer needs. Rails is a very fun framework to work with because it is just so powerful, and you can accomplish more with less code.

If you ever run into any issues when building your application, Rails has comprehensive documentation for (almost) every aspect of Rails. Refer to their documentation if you ever feel really stumped. 

The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:

I've heard these concepts come up a lot during bootcamp, the first concept is D.R.Y., which is an abbreviation for "Don't Repeat Yourself". This is a huge principle of software development which states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." Ruby makes your life as a developer very easy because you can achieve a lot with less code and by not writing the same information over and over again, your code is more maintainable, more extensible, and there are far fewer bugs. It astonished me what you can "DRY" up in Ruby, one line of coders are a frequent occurrence in my [Travelgram](https://github.com/ameerrah9/Travelgram) application.

Another really important principle is "Convention Over Configuration". Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application and defaults to a simple set of conventions.

Rails is an open-source software, so it free to use! Check out this video to learn more on Rails: https://youtu.be/OaDhY_y8WTo

If you've heard of any of these known apps, you probably wouldn't know they were all built with Rails:
Shopify, Airbnb, Twitch, SoundCloud, and Hulu.
